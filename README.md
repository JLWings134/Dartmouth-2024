### Dartmouth-2024

## Inspiration
We were brainstorming ways to make learning fun...and came up with Math-ch!
## What it does
This project is an app that tests the kids' knowledge of certain subjects.
## How we built it
We built this app using Python. Specifically, we utilized the Tkinter Interface.
## Challenges we ran into
One challenge we ran into was switching between slides, and having the pairs of buttons turn green when correctly selected.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
One thing we are proud of is how much we were able to do within a short amount of time with 2 people.
## What we learned
We learned how to build apps using the Tkinter Interface.
## What's next for Math-Ch
Continue making studying more fun! We will add more features like a timer, music selection, more subjects, level difficulty, etc.
