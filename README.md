### Dartmouth-2024

##Inspiration
What inspired us to do this project was that we wanted to do something fun like a game. We were talking about different types of games that make learning and studying more fun. We started talking about the memory game as an option. 

##What it does
This project is an app that tests the kids' knowledge of certain subjects while challenging them to know

##How we built it
We built it using the python tkinter library to create a pop-up window for kids to test their knowledge. 

##Challenges we ran int
One challenge we ran into was that we had trouble getting back to the main page after completing one set of questions or whenever you have to try another section.

##Accomplishments that we're proud of
One thing we are proud of is how much we were able to do within a short amount of time with 2 people.

##What we learned
We learned how to use python better.

##What's next for Math-Ch
The next thing we can do is add more subjects and make different difficult levels to make it available to all kids.
