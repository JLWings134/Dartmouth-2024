# Dartmouth-2024
Inspiration
What inspired us to do this project was that we wanted to do something fun like a game. We were talking about different types of games that make learning and studying more fun. We started talking about the memory game as an option.

What it does
This project is an app that tests the kids' knowledge of certain subjects.

How we built it
Challenges we ran into
One challenge we ran into was that we had trouble getting back to the main page after completing one set of questions or whenever you have to try another section.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
What we learned
What's next for Math-Ch
The next thing we can do is add more subjects and make different difficult levels to make it available to all kids.
